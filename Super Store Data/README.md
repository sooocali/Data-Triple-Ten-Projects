# Super Store Data

This project had me analyze the different items for each store, along with it's performance. I looked into the return rates for each item, and as well as the location of each store for possible correlations. In the end I recommended 3 products to further bolster, along with 3 products to discontinue, and a possible marketing campaign based off of a heart map data and revenues.
