# Air BnB Recommendations

This project focused on AirBnB listings in the New York area. The objective was to provide a recommendations for property investment. After exploring the data, I needed to clean the data for proper usage.
In order to properly find property that met our standards, we had to first evaluate what it meant to be "valuable". In this case, we looked at AirBnBs that drew in the most money, with relevant reviews ( looking only at the last 12 months for relevant reviews.) and other factors.I've created multiple sheets, along with an executive summary, and changes breakdown.
