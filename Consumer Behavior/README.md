# Consumer Behavior

This project focused on conversion funnnels, retention rates, and cohort analysis.

Methodology:
For conversion funnels, I needed to look at customers during each stage, and caclulate the percentages for each one.

Retention rates and Cohort analysis both fell into the similar area. I first split the consumers into different cohorts based on their first purchase. I wanted to see if they continued buying stuff following their first purchase.
By grouping each customer into different cohorts I was able to analyse the retention rate from month to month.
